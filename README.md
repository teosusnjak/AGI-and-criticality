# AGI-and-criticality
This repo is based on a paper and its underlying experiments exploring the intersection of criticality and AGI, examining how the emergent properties of LLMs and their performance across diverse tasks are influenced by complexity theory and the challenges of maintaining optimal functionality at the edge of chaos.
